This is a fork of puppetlabs' showoff that removes a lot of the features
I don't need, such as audience interaction, code execution, timers,
websocket support, rmagick support.  It also modifies the default
styles a bit to suit my tastes.

I use this fork for the conference and meetup presentations I give.
